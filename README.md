# Abstract
##### Date :- December, 2018

## Title :- BRAILLE  INTERFACE  APPLICATION  FOR THE BLIND.
 

### Introduction

Eyedev provides an cost-effective alternative to Refreshable Braille Display Technology. The cost of Braille printer starts from 3 lakhs onwards, which isnâ€™t affordable even for an institute.Even the commercially available Refreshable Braille displays are expensive, with  cheapest model costing 60,000 and Most of these devices  are imported from abroad, with little integration with software. 
	 
As a solution we have made Eyedev which is integrated with Eyeducate, our software which provides blind-friendly user interface. 
Eyeducate is primarily used by shortcuts, it also has voice commands and command - line ( user enter the command to execute).
The app responds to every action the user performs, with help of talkback.

* Pdf to braille
* Text to braille    
* Learning mode

Every feature provides Voice I/O as well as display the content on the Eyedev.
